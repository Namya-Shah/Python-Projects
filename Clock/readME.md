# Clock

## Countdown Timer Readme

This code implements a simple countdown timer in Python. It prompts the user to enter a time duration in seconds and counts down from that value until the timer completes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system

### Getting Started

1. Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.
2. Download the code and save it to a Python file, e.g., `countdown_timer.py`.
3. Run the code using the command `python countdown_timer.py`.
4. Follow the prompts in the console to enter the desired time duration in seconds.

### Usage

1. Upon running the code, you will be prompted to enter a time duration in seconds.
2. Enter the desired duration and press Enter.
3. The countdown timer will start and display the remaining time in minutes and seconds.
4. The timer will decrement by one second every second.
5. Once the timer reaches 0, the message "Timer Completed!" will be displayed.

### Customization

- Adjust the code to perform additional actions or display different messages when the timer completes.
- Customize the input prompt or add input validation as per your requirements.
- Modify the format of the timer display by updating the `timer` variable.
- Add additional functionality or features to enhance the countdown timer.

### Dependencies

The code relies on the following library:

- `time`: Used for time-related operations and sleep function.

### Note

- This code provides a basic implementation and does not include advanced error handling or user interface components.

## Digital Clock Readme

This code implements a simple digital clock using the Tkinter library in Python. It displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds in a graphical window.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system
- Tkinter library installed (usually included with Python)

### Getting Started

1. Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.
2. Download the code and save it to a Python file, e.g., `digital_clock.py`.
3. Run the code using the command `python digital_clock.py`.
4. The digital clock window will appear, displaying the current time.

### Usage

1. Upon running the code, a graphical window titled "Digital Clock" will appear.
2. The window will display the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds.
3. The clock will update every 200 milliseconds to reflect the current time.
4. The clock will continue to run until the program is closed.

### Customization

- Customize the appearance of the clock by modifying the `text_font`, `background`, `foreground`, and `border_width` variables.
- Adjust the update interval of the clock by modifying the `after` function argument (`200` in the provided code) to a different value in milliseconds.
- Add additional features or functionality to the clock, such as date display or time format customization.
- Enhance the code with error handling or additional GUI components as per your requirements.

### Dependencies

The code relies on the following libraries:

- `tkinter`: Used for GUI creation and management.
- `time`: Used for time-related operations and formatting.

### Note

- This code provides a basic implementation of a digital clock using Tkinter. You can further customize and enhance the clock based on your specific requirements.
